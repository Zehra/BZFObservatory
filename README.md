# BZFObservatory
> The observatory for watching the many worlds and those within them.

**In a nutshell:** *BZFObservatory is a CLI app which uses (BZFlag) stats sites API's. It's more efficient in network and memory usage.*

BZFObservatory is a utility which performs a query at intervals for data on which servers have players. It then displays the data in a nice format for easy viewing. The biggest feature is a where it highlights favorite server(s) and friend(s). This displays data in the order of friends and favorites, friends, favorites and finally other active servers/players.

## Background:
Originally this was two simple scripts made as a side project. Known as watcher and observer, one would check servers and the other for players. They were merged and with a friends list and favorites list added as features, this became BZFObservatory. This was then released to the general public and a bit of the code has been cleaned up.

It's a bit more efficient compare to viewing the stats sites normally, but it isn't as lightweight as expected, even though it runs in the shell and doesn't have a fancy GUI.

## TODO:
* Reduce redundant logic
* Add proxy API utility
* Don't depend on a single service.
* Add ability to get live stats on demand.
